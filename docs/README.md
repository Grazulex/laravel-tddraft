# Laravel TDDraft Documentation

Welcome to the Laravel TDDraft documentation. This package provides a structured approach to Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Laravel applications using Pest 3.

## What is Laravel TDDraft?

Laravel TDDraft is a Laravel package that helps you practice Test-Driven Development by providing a separate testing environment for draft tests. It allows you to:

- Create experimental tests without affecting your main test suite
- Practice the Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle
- Keep draft tests separate from production tests
- Maintain clean test suites for CI/CD pipelines
- Access **five essential commands** for complete TDD workflow

## âš¡ Five Essential Commands

Laravel TDDraft provides **five powerful artisan commands** that work together for a complete TDD experience:

| Command | Purpose | Documentation |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **`tdd:init`** | Initialize TDDraft environment | [Commands](commands.md#tdd-init) |
| **`tdd:make`** | Create new draft test with tracking | [Commands](commands.md#tdd-make) |
| **`tdd:test`** | Run draft tests separately | [Commands](commands.md#tdd-test) |
| **`tdd:list`** | List and manage draft tests | [Commands](commands.md#tdd-list) |
| **`tdd:promote`** | Graduate tests to CI suite | [Commands](commands.md#tdd-promote) |

## Quick Start

1. [Install](installation.md) the package
2. Run **`php artisan tdd:init`** to set up your environment
3. Create tests with **`php artisan tdd:make "Test description"`**
4. Run **`php artisan tdd:test`** to test your drafts
